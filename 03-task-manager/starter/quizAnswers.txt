1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

            Middleware in Express adds extra functionality to the 
            request-response cycle. It's added using the use() method 
            and can be used for tasks like logging or authentication.

2. What does CRUD stand for?

            Create, Read, Update, and Delete - functions used when working 
            with persistent data stores

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
a. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

            1. npm install dotenv
            2. Create .env file with your data
            3. Require the dotenv with config method in your code
               require('dotenv').config()
            4. Access the environment variables from the .env 
               file into the process.env object.

b. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your github repository?

            Add the .env file to your .gitignore file so that it is not tracked by Git 
            and not uploaded to your GitHub repository.
